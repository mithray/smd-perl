	# We only want to do this for block-level HTML tags, such as headers,
	# lists, and tables. That's because we still want to wrap <p>s around
	# "paragraphs" that are wrapped in non-block-level tags, such as anchors,
	# phrase emphasis, and spans. The list of tags we're looking for is
	# hard-coded:

	# 	<div>
	# 		<div>
	# 		tags for inner block must be indented.
	# 		</div>
	# 	</div>
	#
	# The outermost tags must start at the left margin for this to match, and
	# the inner nested divs must be indented.
	# We need to do this before the next, more liberal match, because the next
	# match will start at the first `<div>` and stop at the first `</div>`.
